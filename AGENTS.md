# PHASE 0 — Maintain libmscore (WASM) as the Engraving Backbone

## High-Level Goal

Phase 0 aims to produce a functional, browser-based musical score editor as quickly as possible by using MuseScore’s existing engraving engine (libmscore) compiled to WebAssembly. The intention is to avoid implementing any layout or rendering logic in this phase, allowing rapid iteration on web UI, workflows, collaboration models, and AST handling.

This phase is explicitly designed to unblock product development while deferring all nonessential complexity (layout engines, custom renderers, constraint solvers) to later phases.

**The output should be a working editor where scores load, render, and respond to user input.**

## Core Principle: Reuse Maximum Functionality From libmscore

`libmscore` is MuseScore’s internal engraving engine and score model. When compiled to WASM (via the existing “webmscore” project), it can run entirely in the browser.

Phase 0 deliberately relies heavily on this engine for:
*   Parsing MSCZ/MusicXML input
*   Semantic model creation (MuseScore AST)
*   Layout (spacing, collisions, beaming, slurs, ties)
*   Rendering to SVG

The key design constraint in Phase 0 is:
**Do not re-implement anything that libmscore already provides unless absolutely necessary.**

This allows the editor to ship early in a stable form.

## Primary Capabilities Required in Phase 0

Future phases will gradually replace libmscore, but for Phase 0 the system must be able to:

### 1. Load Scores in the Browser
*   Accept MSCZ (MuseScore compressed scores)
*   Accept MusicXML files
*   Pass raw data to webmscore for parsing
*   **Output:** A MuseScore AST object residing on the WASM side.

### 2. Render the Score to SVG
*   Use webmscore’s built-in APIs for layout → SVG generation
*   Inject resulting SVG into the web framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
*   This produces a visually correct, fully engraved score without implementing layout code.

### 3. Display the Rendered Score in a Browser UI
*   Wrap the generated SVG in an interactive component
*   Support zoom, pan, scrolling
*   Attach hit-testing overlays or coordinate mapping
*   This is the beginning of the web-native editor UI.

### 4. Enable Note/Element Selection
*   Use either:
    *   SVG event listeners, or
    *   Hit-test queries via webmscore
*   Highlight selected notes, rests, measures, slurs, etc.
*   Selection is the foundation for editing operations.

### 5. Manipulate the Score Through JS→WASM API Calls
This is the critical bridge. You must expose (or wrap) WASM-side functions for:
*   Altering pitches
*   Changing durations
*   Inserting/deleting notes or measures
*   Adding articulations
*   Modifying clefs/time signatures
*   Toggling accidentals, ties, slurs

All of these mutate the internal MuseScore AST stored in WASM memory. Each mutation triggers a:
1.  WASM AST update
2.  Re-layout
3.  Re-render → SVG
4.  UI refresh

### 6. Implement Undo/Redo
High-level requirement:
*   Capture semantic operations (not DOM diffs)
*   Store a linear or branchable history of AST-level intentions
*   Since the renderer re-generates SVG each time, undo/redo is implemented at the model level.

### 7. Handle Semantic Diff/Merge
For multi-user collaboration and version control:
*   Serialize MuseScore AST → JSON-like neutral format (Phase 1 formalizes this)
*   Compute diff between versions
*   Merge changes where possible
*   Phase 0 provides the API skeleton for diff/merge, even if a clean AST format is finalized later.

### 8. Primary Focus: Web Editor UX
Because engraving is fully delegated to WASM, Phase 0 developer effort must concentrate on:
*   UI layout and ergonomics
*   Responsiveness
*   Interactions with SVG
*   Navigation
*   Visual feedback for editing
*   Selection logic
*   File loading/saving
*   Basic toolbars (note duration palette, accidentals, etc.)

This ensures rapid end-to-end functionality.

    end

    subgraph UI_Container [Web UI]
        SVGView[SVG-based Score View (DOM <svg>, event listeners)]
    end
```

**Key design features:**
*   Rendering is one-way (webmscore → SVG → UI)
*   Editing is command-based (UI → WASM mutation → re-render)
*   Undo/redo uses semantic commands, not diffing SVG
*   All complex music theory/layout logic lives inside WASM

## Technical Constraints and Considerations

### 1. Licensing
*   libmscore is GPL; Phase 0 cannot be shipped as a closed-source browser product if WASM is client-side.
*   Server-only engraving (fallback mode) avoids this, but Phase 0 assumes client-side WASM for fastest development.

### 2. Performance
*   WASM execution is fast enough for full re-layout on each change.
*   SVG injection is cheap because:
    *   SVG is static
    *   Rendering happens only when the AST changes.

### 3. State Management
*   Keep WASM AST as the single source of truth.
*   UI state mirrors selections, cursors, tools, etc.
*   Use a unidirectional data flow model.

### 4. Editor Extensibility
Phase 0 must leave space for:
*   Custom AST
*   Custom layout engine
*   Incremental rendering
*   Future ML modules
*   Multi-user collaboration

The system is designed so that libmscore can be swapped out later without rewriting the UI.

## Deliverables Expected From Phase 0

1.  **Load-and-render pipeline:**
    *   MSCZ or MusicXML → WASM → SVG → UI
2.  **Basic editor UI:**
    *   Note selection and highlighting
    *   Zoom/pan/scroll
    *   Basic editing tools (pitch change, duration change)
3.  **AST mutation layer (via WASM bridge):**
    *   A JS API that issues commands to mutate the score in WASM.
4.  **Undo/redo manager:**
    *   Command-based
    *   Replays semantic operations, not SVG diffs
5.  **Diff/merge prototype:**
    *   Basic abstractions for versioning AST snapshots
6.  **Stable UX foundation:**
    *   Panels, toolbars, keyboard shortcuts
    *   React/Vue/Svelte state management
    *   Components for systems, measures, notes
7.  **Documentation of public APIs for Phase 1 integration:**
    *   AST access layer
    *   Layout/render triggers
    *   Selection model
    *   Mutation commands

## Guiding Principles for Phase 0

*   **Velocity > optimality.** The goal is to produce a functioning editor quickly.
*   **Do not prematurely replace the engraver.** libmscore is used as-is for now.
*   **Keep architecture modular.** All APIs should be designed so that future phases can replace libmscore with a web-native engine.
*   **Focus on UX and workflow correctness.** Rendering can be replaced later; UX cannot.
*   **Don’t over-engineer the AST format yet.** But prepare a clean bridge layer for future abstraction.
